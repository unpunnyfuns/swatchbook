# `feat/token-graph` — branch status

Long-lived feature branch implementing the **token-graph redesign**: replacing `Project.cells + Project.jointOverrides + Project.varianceByPath` with a single walkable `Project.tokenGraph`. The 15M `resolver.apply` workload that triggered the redesign now resolves structurally with bounded apply calls at build time.

## Branch policy

- **No PR-to-main until Phase 7.** This file is the read-once orientation for anyone fetching the branch.
- Shared utilities (`value-key.ts`, etc.) may be modified directly — the branch is purposely heading toward the new architecture, not living alongside the old in any preservationist sense.
- Format / lint sweeps that ride along with task commits are accepted as natural maintenance.
- Spec + implementation plan are **local-only** (gitignored under `docs/superpowers/`). If you need them, look in the originating session or ask the maintainer for a copy.

## Phase tracker

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | ✅ done | Branch created from `main` (c6df619) |
| 1 | ✅ done | `packages/core/src/token-graph/` module: builder, walker, queries, diagnostics, `/graph` subpath. Cross-validated against `resolver.apply` for the entire reference-fixture cartesian. Wired into `loadProject` alongside legacy fields. (range: c6df619..2a4274b) |
| 2 | ✅ done | `snapshot-for-wire`, addon virtual module, blocks React context all expose `tokenGraph` (commits 513baa1, 7df5da0, 6b7db4e). |
| 3 | ⏳ in progress | Block migrations one-by-one (TokenTable, ColorTable, TokenDetail, AxisVariance, TokenNavigator). |
| 4 | pending | Smart emitter (`css-axis-projected.ts`) + MCP `get_axis_variance` switch to graph walks. CSS byte-for-byte regression gate. |
| 5 | pending | Bench against real-consumer workload. **Gate**: build < 200ms, resolveAt < 1ms/call, ≥5× faster loadProject startup. STOP if gate fails. |
| 6 | pending | Delete `cells.ts`, `joint-overrides.ts`, `alias-graph.ts`, `resolve-at.ts`, `variance-by-path.ts`, `variance-analysis.ts`; remove legacy fields from `Project`. |
| 7 | pending | Sync with main, changeset, docs-site updates, open PR. |

## Last completed task

**Task 2.3** — `tokenGraph` exposed on the blocks React context via `useProject()` (commit `6b7db4e`). Phase 2 closed out.

## Next up

**Phase 3 — Block migrations.** One block at a time, replace `cells` / `varianceByPath` / `jointOverrides` reads with `tokenGraph`-based queries from `@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-core/graph`. Order: TokenTable, ColorTable, TokenDetail, AxisVariance, TokenNavigator + any remainder.

## In-flight decisions / notes

- `valueKey` was updated in Phase 1 (commit `03bb7b9`) to sort object keys recursively. This was originally framed as a violation of "alongside existing code" but was clarified as in-scope for long-lived feature branches.
- `tsdown.config.ts` doesn't exist in `packages/core`; the build is driven by `scripts.build` CLI invocation in `package.json`. New entrypoints (`/graph` was the first) are added there.
- `Project.tokenGraph` for layered/plain-parse projects (no resolver) is an empty graph; only resolver-backed projects build a real one. Phase 5+ may revisit if layered projects need walker support.
