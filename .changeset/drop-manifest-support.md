Drop Tokens Studio `$themes` manifest support. The DTCG 2025.10 resolver is now the spec-native theming input; consumers using a manifest should convert to a `resolver.json` (the transformation is mechanical). `Config.manifest` is removed, `resolveThemingMode` returns `'layered' | 'resolver'`, and `themingMode` on the virtual module narrows accordingly. `@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-tokens-reference` no longer exports `manifestPath`.
