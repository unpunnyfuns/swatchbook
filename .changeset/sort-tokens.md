Two behavioural changes to the list-style blocks (`TokenTable`, `ColorPalette`, `TokenNavigator`-adjacent, `TypographyScale`, `DimensionScale`, `FontWeightScale`, `GradientPalette`, `StrokeStyleSample`, `FontFamilySample`, `BorderPreview`, `ShadowPreview`):

- **Fix empty renders for typed-but-differently-pathed tokens.** Every block defaulted its `filter` prop to its `$type` name (`filter = 'fontFamily'`, `filter = 'dimension'`, etc.), which treated the type name as a **path** glob. Projects whose token paths don't coincidentally start with the type name (e.g. `font.ref.weight.*` for `fontWeight`) rendered as empty. Defaults removed — the `$type` check inside each block already scopes correctly, `filter` is purely additive for narrowing.
- **Add `sortBy` / `sortDir` props.** `sortBy: 'path' | 'value' | 'none'` (default `'path'`, except `DimensionScale` and `FontWeightScale` which default to `'value'` to preserve their pixel/weight-ordered layout). `sortDir: 'asc' | 'desc'`. `'value'` ordering uses numeric magnitude for `dimension` / `duration` / `fontWeight`, perceptual oklch L → C → H for `color`, lexicographic for `fontFamily` / `strokeStyle`, and falls through to path for composites where a one-dimensional "value" isn't meaningful.
