`@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-core`: `loadProject` no longer calls `resolver.listPermutations()`. The resolver-backed loader now enumerates only **singletons** — the axes-defaults tuple plus one per `(axis, non-default-context)` — so total `resolver.apply` calls are bounded by `Σ(axes × contexts)` instead of the cartesian product. Pathological resolvers (terrazzo#752: 15M tuples) load in milliseconds instead of OOMing.

`Project.cells` now stores **delta cells** for non-default contexts: each non-default `(axis, context)` cell holds only the tokens whose value differs from the default-cell baseline. Default cells stay as full TokenMaps. Delta cells make `composeAt` correct under sparse composition — a later axis's cell can't accidentally overwrite an earlier axis's overlay on a token the later axis doesn't touch.

`probeJointOverrides` now falls back to the baseline TokenMap when a delta cell omits a path, so the "axis A's cell alone would produce" comparison stays accurate. The CSS axis-projected emitter passes the full composed TokenMap separately for alias resolution while emitting per-axis cell deltas, so smart-dedup re-emit (the previous cascade trick) is no longer needed — joint compound `[data-axis-A][data-axis-B]` blocks handle the joint-variance cases.

Public API removed (pre-1.0 minor bump):

- `resolvePermutation()` export.
- `ResolvedPermutation` type.

`Project.permutations` and `Project.permutationsResolved` are retained for now (still keyed against the singleton enumeration); the layered loader continues to use cartesian enumeration unchanged.

`Config.maxPermutations` is documented as **layered-only** — the resolver path is intrinsically bounded.
