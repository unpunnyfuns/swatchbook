**Breaking**: remove the addon's Design Tokens panel. Composing `<Diagnostics />` + `<TokenNavigator />` + `<TokenTable />` on an MDX page now serves the same role the panel played — see the [token-dashboard guide](https://unpunnyfuns.github.io/swatchbook/guides/token-dashboard). The `PANEL_ID` constant is removed from the public API; the `swatchbook/design-tokens` panel tab is no longer registered. Channel events and everything outside the panel itself are unchanged.
