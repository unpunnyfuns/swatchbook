**Breaking.** `SwatchbookProvider`, `SwatchbookContext`, `ThemeContext`, `AxesContext`, `useSwatchbookData`, `useOptionalSwatchbookData`, `useActiveTheme`, `useActiveAxes`, and the `Virtual*Shape` / `ProjectSnapshot` types now live exclusively in `@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-blocks`. They are no longer exported from `@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-addon` — import them from `@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-blocks` directly. Workspace dep graph runs addon → blocks, which is the direction it was always meant to. Closes issue #202.
