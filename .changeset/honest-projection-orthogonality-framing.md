`@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-core`: honest the orthogonality framing on `emitAxisProjectedCss`. JSDoc + test descriptions previously called the orthogonality requirement a "usage constraint," implying the consumer was responsible for authoring orthogonal modifiers. The DTCG Resolver Module 2025.10 spec explicitly permits non-orthogonal modifiers (Primer's "Pirate" light-only theme is the rationale doc's own example); projection is a lossy size optimization for them, not a contract. Cartesian (`emitCss`) is the spec-faithful default. Docs only — no behavior change.
