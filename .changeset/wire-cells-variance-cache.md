`@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-addon`, `@unpunnyfuns/swatchbook-blocks`: ship `cells`, `jointOverrides`, `varianceByPath`, and `defaultTuple` over the virtual module and HMR snapshot, alongside the existing `permutationsResolved` (additive). Blocks-side `ProjectSnapshot` / `ProjectData` expose the new fields. The `AxisVariance` block drops its `analyzeAxisVariance(...)` call in favor of an O(1) `varianceByPath[path]` lookup. Other block migrations (TokenTable / TokenDetail / ColorTable reading via `resolveAt`) ship in a later PR.
